<h2>1. Shark Tales</h2>

<p>This movie is funny , I remember watching this movie at maybe 6 or 5 years old and my favoriate characters were always the Jellyfish! and of course Oscar the main fish. Although it is not the newest movie I always got love for the old classics, especially a kid movie ! </p>
